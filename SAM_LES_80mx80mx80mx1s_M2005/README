 Case Description
--------------------
This working directory is for ARM0003 IOP case with a 80mx80mx80m grid of number 1536x1536x110.
The MICROPHYSICS scheme is M2005.
The spin-up time is selected to be 5 days (nstop=86400*5) now (20150824) for time-scales of convective processes.






5252527 is a success case, the previous one 5262127 has segmentation fault with the same 'prm' setup, reason might be over-subscription of the CPU? <----------- bad node?
